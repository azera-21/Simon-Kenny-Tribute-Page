            <h2>About Simon Kenny</h2>
            <p>Dramatic, atmospheric and totally captivating, Simon Kennyâ€™s abstract paintings are internationally recognized and truly dynamic.</p>
            <p>Represented by some of the finest galleries in the UK and now expanding into Europe and Asia, Simon's work is highly collectible across the globe.</p>
            <p>His paintings are deliberately not specific to any place or time, as Simon's aim is for the viewer to develop and build their own personal connections with each piece.</p> 
            <p>Whether his images remind you of somewhere you have seen, or invoke a emotion or memory, he aims to balance both a sense of materialism and spiritualism through this abstraction.</p> 
            <p>I ndeed, as he starts on a new painting, Simon himself begins on a journey through a host of emotions, which are carefully considered and expressed through both colour and form, offering the viewer a direct visual connection to his mindset.</p>
            <p>Simon's fascination with the world around him is palpable through his work. His depictions of nature form a myriad of emotions as he uses painting to better understand the human condition to which we are all bound.</p> 
            <p>The beauty of his work is how it compliments and reflects your own thoughts and feelings. </p>
            <p>At times an image can seem tranquil and harmonized whereas on a different day, the same scene can appear tumultuous and unruly. </p>
            <p>This emotional creativity is the heart and soul of Simon's abstract paintings and by infusing his own distinctive style with a radical 'Turneresque' quality, these vibrant images are totally unique in every sense.</p>
            <p>Stephen Hawking recognised Simon Kenny's work, stating: <em>"It is everything about space I cannot explain".</em></p>
